# UNIWA Student Management System (Java)

Console-based Student Management System developed in Java as part of MSc coursework.

## Overview

This application implements a basic student management system using Object-Oriented Programming principles. The system allows users to manage student records through a menu-driven console interface.

## Features

- View all students
- Add new student
- Search by name
- Search by phone
- Edit student
- Delete student

## Technical Concepts Demonstrated

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation (private attributes + getters/setters)
- ArrayList data structure
- CRUD logic implementation
- Input handling using Scanner
- Method-based program structuring
- Basic validation for numeric input

## Project Structure

```text
src/
├── MainP.java
└── Student.java

## How to Run

1. Open project in any Java IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / NetBeans)
2. Run `MainP.java`
3. Use the console menu

## Future Improvements

- Persistent storage (file or database)
- Exception handling improvements
- Unique ID validation
- Refactoring to layered architecture
